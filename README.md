## ðŸ“Œ Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**  
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications**

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
- **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
- **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sql-data-warehouse-project
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` file and set your secure database password:
   ```bash
   MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
   ```

3. **Start the services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Verify the setup**
   The SQL Server will be available at `localhost:1433`

### Security Note
- The `.env` file contains sensitive credentials and is excluded from version control
- Never commit actual passwords to the repository
- Use the `.env.example` file as a template for required environment variables
